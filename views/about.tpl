<p>My part was to develop a program that could find a spanning tree of the given graph using the "breadth-first" search algorithm. In addition, I developed Terms of reference, was responsible for organising communication between team members, and made UML diagrams for the website.</p>
<h4>Balabkina Anastasia</h4>
<img class ="image" src="{{get_url('static', filename='img/nastya.jpg')}}" width=200>
<p>My part was to develop a program that could find a spanning tree of the given graph using the "in depth" search algorithm. In addition, I was responsible for organising a space for collaboration, was working with Alina on an algorithm for data input in files from the pages, developed a module for connectivicy check, edited the authors page descriptions.</p>
<h4>Grigoryeva Olga</h4>
<img class ="image" src="{{get_url('static', filename='img/olya.jpg')}}" width=200>
<p>My part was to develop a program that could find the shortest spanning tree of a given graph using Kruskal's algorithm. I also made the main page and the authors page, the README file.</p>
<h4>Remneva Alina</h4>
<img class ="image" src="{{get_url('static', filename='img/alina.jpg')}}" width=200>
<p>My part was to develop a program that could find the shortest backbone using the Prim's algorithm. In addition, I created our repository on Github and was responsible for solving problems with it, was working on the page styles. Anastasia and I were also working on an algorithm for data input in files from the pages.</p>

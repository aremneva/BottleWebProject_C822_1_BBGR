<p>My part was to develop a program that could find the shortest backbone using the Prim's algorithm. In addition, I developed technical specification. Also, Anastasia and I, using special tools, made an organizational and navigation part for the communication of the project participants</p>

<h4>Balabkina Anastasia</h4>

<p>My part was to develop a program that could find the spanning tree of a given graph using the "in depth" search algorithm. Alina and I were working on an algorithm for entering data in the form of a table.</p>

<h4>Grigireva Olga</h4>
<img class ="image" src="{{get_url('static', filename='img/olya.jpg')}}" width=200>
<p>My part was to develop a program that could find the shortest spanning tree of a given graph using Kruskal's algorithm. I also made the main page and this page. Alina and I wrote README.</p>

<h4>Remneva Alina</h4>

<p>My part was to develop a program that could find the spanning tree of a given graph using the "breadth-first" search algorithm. Anastasia and I have developed an algorithm for entering data in the form of a table. I created our repository on Github and solved problems with it.</p>
